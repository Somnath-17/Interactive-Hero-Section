## 🚀 How It Works

1. The hero section displays the text:
   WE BELIEVE  
BRANDS SHAPE  
FUTURE

2. When you move the mouse over the center area, a random industry-themed image spawns at the cursor.

3. The image animates in and out with blur, rotation, scaling, and opacity transitions.

4 Each image is removed from the DOM after the animation completes (optimized memory usage).
